## Cracking 1 / Cracking

#### Solution
- `file cracking1.exe`: Identify exact file type
   - PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
- `ldd cracking1.exe`: Print shared object dependencies
   -  Since we talk about a .exe file we only get "not a dynamic executable" as response
- `nm cracking1.exe`: searches the executable/binary for important data structures and functions
   - no symbols (because cracking1.exe is stripped unfortunately)
- `binwalk cracking1.exe`: extract data from binary

- `strings -n 6 cracking1.exe`: Looks for strings

- `objdump cracking1.exe -s`: Display information from object by resembling assembler instructions
   - `-s` = full contents 
   - not much new output  
- `objdump cracking1.exe -d`: Display assembly code
   - `-d` = disassemble 
   - good output but not so handy as real Reverse Engineering tools

All those tools mentioned above give us a first impression about what this .exe contains, but to get deeper into program flow and structure we need a Revere Engineering tool. There are several tools available, but for now we will take a look at **ollydbg** only.

- If not yet installed: `sudo apt install ollydbg`
- Initial info: [https://www.kali.org/tools/ollydbg/](https://www.kali.org/tools/ollydbg/)
- I will roughly describe what I did, however, honestly speaking it's easier to demonstrate such tools along with a video
- Despite that fact, I stick to comments in this markdown for efficiency purpose ;-)

1. Load crackin1.exe into ollydbg
2. Right click in the main thread, select "search for" and then "all referenced text strings". This brings us to this overview:

Finally we find the password: **JE74toJNZ75** ðŸ™‚
