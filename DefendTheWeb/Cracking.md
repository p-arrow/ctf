#### Solution
- To get a better understanding of the program flow and structure we need a Revere Engineering tool
- There are several tools available, but for now we will take a look at **ollydbg** only
- If not yet installed: `sudo apt install ollydbg`
- Initial info: [https://www.kali.org/tools/ollydbg/](https://www.kali.org/tools/ollydbg/)

1. Load cracking1.exe into ollydbg
2. Right click in the main thread, select "search for" and then "all referenced text strings". This brings us to this overview:

3. Before the welcome text `Hello challengers...` starts we identify the name **kevin**. It might be a username?

4. We place breakpoints after the input of username and password. It's recommended to do so at the line with `CMP`
5. At `REPE CMPS` strings from `EDI` and `ESI` are compared repetitive. Namely our entered "kevin" and the hardcoded string "kevin". Look at Registers `ESI` and `EDI` on the right hand side

6. At the next breakpoint most probably password comparison takes place. The value `200B2` and the pointer at `ESP+14` are of interest
7. At the register window we do right-click on `ESP` and select `Follow in Dump` to see what `ESP` contains

8. At the dump window we see the content of `ESP` address `0060FE30` 
9. We recognize the string **JE74toJNZ75** at address `0060FE54` ðŸ™‚
